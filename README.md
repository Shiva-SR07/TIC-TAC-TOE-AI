# TIC-TAC-TOE-AI
A Tic-Tac-Toe AI in Eclipse uses a **minimax algorithm** to find the optimal move. This algorithm recursively evaluates all future game states, assigning scores for win/loss/draw. **Alpha-beta pruning** makes it faster by skipping less promising paths. The board is represented by a 2D array, with logic to manage turns and check win conditions.
